# FizzBuzz
Coding Dojo had me do FizzBuzz as an exercise! 
### Objectives:
* For each number that is a multiple of 3, print `"Fizz"`
* For each number that is a multiple of 5, print `"Buzz"`
* For numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "`FizzBuzz"`
### Additional functionality for extra practice:
* I decided to do it in Python as well just because I'm learning Python on the side.
